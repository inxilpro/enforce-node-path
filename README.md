> **Please Note:** Due to the very limited scope of this module, I do not anticipate needing to make very many changes to it.  Expect long stretches of zero updatesâ€”that does not mean that the module is outdated.

This simple module enforces usage of the `NODE_PATH` environmental variable to make loading _application modules_ (modules that are not in `node_modules`) in Node.js more consistent.

## Why?

The [Node.js module loader](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_the_global_folders) uses a special environmental variable called `NODE_PATH`:

> If the `NODE_PATH` environment variable is set to a colon-delimited list of absolute paths, then Node.js will search those paths for modules if they are not found elsewhere.

This means that if you set the `NODE_PATH` environmental variable to the root of your application, you can load application files relative to your root directory wherever you are.

Assuming that `NODE_PATH` set to `/var/www`:

``` js
// In /var/www/server/router.js
var routes = require('config/routes.json'); // Looks in /var/www/config/routes.json
```

Unfortunately, the module loader caches this environmental variable before your app runs, so it's not possible to set `process.env.NODE_PATH` after the fact.  And as the [docs state](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_the_global_folders), relying on this variable can be dangerous because developers may not know that it needs to be set.  **This module makes that dependency explicit and triggers an error if it's not set.**

## Installation

``` bash
$ npm install enforce-node-path --save
```

## Usage

**As close to the top of your app's entry point,** add the following code:

``` js
var enforceNodePath = require('enforce-node-path');
enforceNodePath(__dirname);
```

If `NODE_PATH` is not set to `__dirname` (`path.resolve` is used, so they just have to resolve to the same directory), an `Error` is thrown.

It is recommended that you set this environmental variable in your npm scripts section so that `npm start` just works:

``` json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "NODE_PATH=. node index.js",
  }
}
```
